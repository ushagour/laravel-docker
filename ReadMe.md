This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-service Docker application. Let's go through each service:

### 1. `laravel-docker` Service
- **Purpose**: This container is meant to run a Laravel application.
- **container_name**: The container will be named `laravel-docker`.
- **build**: It indicates that the container should be built from a Dockerfile located in the current directory (`.`). The contents of the Dockerfile will determine the exact setup of this container, including the web server used.
- **volumes**: 
  - `./laravel-app:/var/www/html`: This binds the local directory `./laravel-app` to the container's directory `/var/www/html`. This allows for the sharing of files between your host machine and the Docker container, making development easier as changes to files are immediately reflected in the container.
- **ports**:
  - `9000:80`: This maps port 80 inside the container (commonly used by web servers like Apache or Nginx) to port 9000 on your host machine. You can access the web application by navigating to `http://localhost:9000`.

The web server used in this container is determined by the Dockerfile. Based on the previous conversation, if you're using a Dockerfile similar to the one you shared, which started with `FROM php:8.1.0-apache`, then Apache is used as the web server. However, if you're using a different Dockerfile with `nginx` and `php-fpm`, then Nginx would be used instead.

### 2. `mysql_db` Service
- **image**: This uses the latest version of the MySQL Docker image, which provides the MySQL database server.
- **environment**: 
  - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root`: Sets the root password for MySQL to `root`. 
  - `MYSQL_DATABASE: taravel_docker`: Creates a database named `taravel_docker` upon initialization.
- **ports**:
  - `3306:3306`: This maps port 3306 inside the container (MySQL's default port) to port 3306 on the host machine. You can connect to this database using a MySQL client on your host machine at `localhost:3306`.

### 3. `phpmyadmin` Service
- **image**: Uses the latest version of the phpMyAdmin Docker image, a web interface for managing MySQL databases.
- **ports**:
  - `9001:80`: Maps port 80 inside the container (where phpMyAdmin serves its web interface) to port 9001 on the host machine. You can access phpMyAdmin by navigating to `http://localhost:9001`.
- **environment**:
  - `PMA_ARBITRARY=1`: Allows phpMyAdmin to connect to any MySQL server. This is useful for accessing multiple databases or servers.

### Conclusion

To determine the web server used by `laravel-docker`, you need to refer to the Dockerfile used to build this service. If it starts with `FROM php:8.1.0-apache`, then Apache is used. If you're using `nginx` and `php-fpm`, the Dockerfile should reflect that setup. The current `docker-compose.yml` file setup suggests that the Laravel application will run alongside MySQL and phpMyAdmin, all accessible through specified ports on your host machine.

###  Nb 
there is 2 more steps to do to remove the public/index.php from the URL 


1. Use a Custom Dockerfile
You need to modify Apacheâ€™s configuration, the best practice is to create a custom Docker image with your modifications.

```
FROM php:8.1.0-apache
WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Mod Rewrite
RUN a2enmod rewrite

# Copy your custom Apache configuration file
COPY ./my-custom-apache-config.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

# Linux Library
RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y \
    libicu-dev \
    libmariadb-dev \
    unzip zip \
    zlib1g-dev \
    libpng-dev \
    libjpeg-dev \
    libfreetype6-dev \
    libjpeg62-turbo-dev \
    libpng-dev 

# Composer
COPY --from=composer:latest /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer



# Ensure permissions are correct
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html \
    && chmod -R 755 /var/www/html


# PHP Extension
RUN docker-php-ext-install gettext intl pdo_mysql gd

RUN docker-php-ext-configure gd --enable-gd --with-freetype --with-jpeg \
    && docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) gd
```


Step 2: Move .htaccess to the Root Directory
Move the .htaccess file from the public directory to the root of your Laravel project (the same directory where your composer.json file is located).
