This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-service Docker application. Let's go through each service:

### 1. `laravel-docker` Service
- **Purpose**: This container is meant to run a Laravel application.
- **container_name**: The container will be named `laravel-docker`.
- **build**: It indicates that the container should be built from a Dockerfile located in the current directory (`.`). The contents of the Dockerfile will determine the exact setup of this container, including the web server used.
- **volumes**: 
  - `./laravel-app:/var/www/html`: This binds the local directory `./laravel-app` to the container's directory `/var/www/html`. This allows for the sharing of files between your host machine and the Docker container, making development easier as changes to files are immediately reflected in the container.
- **ports**:
  - `9000:80`: This maps port 80 inside the container (commonly used by web servers like Apache or Nginx) to port 9000 on your host machine. You can access the web application by navigating to `http://localhost:9000`.

The web server used in this container is determined by the Dockerfile. Based on the previous conversation, if you're using a Dockerfile similar to the one you shared, which started with `FROM php:8.1.0-apache`, then Apache is used as the web server. However, if you're using a different Dockerfile with `nginx` and `php-fpm`, then Nginx would be used instead.

### 2. `mysql_db` Service
- **image**: This uses the latest version of the MySQL Docker image, which provides the MySQL database server.
- **environment**: 
  - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root`: Sets the root password for MySQL to `root`. 
  - `MYSQL_DATABASE: taravel_docker`: Creates a database named `taravel_docker` upon initialization.
- **ports**:
  - `3306:3306`: This maps port 3306 inside the container (MySQL's default port) to port 3306 on the host machine. You can connect to this database using a MySQL client on your host machine at `localhost:3306`.

### 3. `phpmyadmin` Service
- **image**: Uses the latest version of the phpMyAdmin Docker image, a web interface for managing MySQL databases.
- **ports**:
  - `9001:80`: Maps port 80 inside the container (where phpMyAdmin serves its web interface) to port 9001 on the host machine. You can access phpMyAdmin by navigating to `http://localhost:9001`.
- **environment**:
  - `PMA_ARBITRARY=1`: Allows phpMyAdmin to connect to any MySQL server. This is useful for accessing multiple databases or servers.

### Conclusion

To determine the web server used by `laravel-docker`, you need to refer to the Dockerfile used to build this service. If it starts with `FROM php:8.1.0-apache`, then Apache is used. If you're using `nginx` and `php-fpm`, the Dockerfile should reflect that setup. The current `docker-compose.yml` file setup suggests that the Laravel application will run alongside MySQL and phpMyAdmin, all accessible through specified ports on your host machine.
